- PONG REPOSITORY
This is my PONG repository.
With this repository I will try to create PONG in as many different languages as I can.

The master branch only contains this README file.
Each branch will contain a specific language implementation.

Check the readme file within each branch to see instructions.

-- HTML5 Canvas and Javascript

* I learned how to work with JavaScript classes.
* This is the first version of Pong that I created.
* This version uses a font that is free for personal use, not for distribution.
    I did not include it in my commit.
    Download it here: https://www.1001fonts.com/arcadeclassic-font.html#styles

* I'm not sure if I should influence game state from the ball class or if I should return values.
* I'm not sure the game constant should be a constant or a class.
* It would be nice to refactor into different JavaScript modules.
